#Playing with memory models

In my low level computing class, we are learning about how the system manages system memory. I generally understand things better concepetually when I try to implement them myself. Thus, this.

Obviously, Python is a little to high-level to really manipulate memory, but I figured it would be fun (and worth the save in frustration) to try to model a memory system on a high level. I'm not sure how this program could ever possibly be useful in the real world, but it was great for educational purposes, so I'm sharing it.
